        <p>What happens when a Data Science Expert travels all over the world for business, trying to spice up his travel after getting bored from structured hotel environments. Our Founder, Dr. Murat Sonmez, started experiencing Short Term Rentals (STR) a few years back, and realized that the STR market is a community of strangers.</p>
        <p>In this community, Dr. Sonmez discovered that there is a risk, trust and transparency problem inherent in the sector. In order to better understand a solution for the risk/trust problem, he actively participated as a Host, operating a unit. Many inconsistencies between declared data and what comes out as a reality during the stay occurred. This was the insight leading to the development of the most comprehensive, data analytics trust confidence solution available in the STR market...Trust-d.</p>
        <p>Our Vision is to inspire a global "community of transparent trust" for today's sharing world.</p>

        <p>Our innovative approach to the problem is to look at the consumer from the "right" angle in the Shairng Economy, while we focus on the "Consumer", and bring the consumer at the center of the problem.</p>
        <p>Solution comes after understanding the dynamics of each verticals of the Sharing Economy, and re-defining the consumer to fit the needs of each verticals. </p>
        <p>We evaluatethe consumers in the shairng economy in a way that, each consumer has a static and dynamic trust attributes. Each consumer lives in a community, interact with firends and families, has a professional life, conducts financial transactions, has some degree of education etc. These attributes are associated with each consumer forms what we call "<strong>static trust attributes</strong>". For example, from this perspective, a credit score is nothing more than a "financial trust", providing a trust measure for the consumer from financial perspective. Then, we can easily extend this concept to the community, and the professional trust measures. These attributes do NOT change from one vertial to another. For instance, when a consumer uses AirBnB, or Uber, or in any P2P transaction, these atribuets do not change.</p>
        <p>However, there are some parameters which change from one Verticals to another. All transactional activities in each Sharing Economy verticals are dynamic, and are diferent from one vertical to another.  For instance, a person may have great review in AirBnB, but her/his review in Uber may be not that great.  These reviews are transactional and when evaluated alone, they do not give much information about the trust.However, when combined with Static Trust Attributes we described above, these reviews bring a "vertical specific information" to the trust measure. </p>
        <p>Our patent pending Artificial Intelligence (AI) based solution provides a unique combination of all these Static and Dynamic Trust attributes, and probides a much better  trust confidence metrics for the consumption of the Sharing Economy participants.</p>
